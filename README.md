Hominid Evolution Visualization Dashboard
This dashboard project focuses on analyzing the evolutionary traits, geographic distribution, and environmental adaptations of various hominid species using interactive visualizations created in Tableau. The goal is to uncover trends in physical features, cerebral capacity, diet, and habitat preferences across different time periods and regions.

 
 Tools & Techniques
Visualization Tool: Tableau was used for its strong interactive features, ease of use, and ability to handle complex datasets.
Enhancements: Calculated fields, table calculations, and parameter controls were implemented to improve user engagement and filtering options.
 

 Data Pre-processing
Initial data inspection using Python (Pandas) confirmed that there were no missing or incomplete values.
Categorical attributes (e.g., Incisor Size, Canine Size, Tooth Enamel, Hip Size) were converted into numerical values (1, 2, 3â€¦) to support visualization compatibility.
Additional transformations and calculated fields were created directly within Tableau to support analytical queries and dynamic visuals.


Key Research Questions
What are the regional differences in hominid distribution?
Which hominid species are most common?
How do traits vary across evolutionary periods?
What regions show the greatest fossil diversity?
What were preferred habitats of different species?
How are environments linked to appearance and diet?
What is the relationship between brain size and tool use?
Is there a trend of increasing cerebral capacity?
How has stature evolved over time?
Are there patterns in tooth morphology changes?
What did hominids eat, and how did diets evolve?


This project merges paleoanthropological insights with modern data visualization techniques to provide an accessible and engaging view into human evolutionary history.
